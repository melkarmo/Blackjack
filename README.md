# Blackjack

This project is an implementation of Blackjack in Java with basic components.  

The code is very basic, clean and easy to undestand, and makes great use of object-oriented programming principles.  
The game is played using the output console for display and a JFrame with buttons for betting (see the screenshot below).

*Environment :* NetBeans IDE 8.2, JDK 1.8
